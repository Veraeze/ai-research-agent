 The AI bubble is the result of a series of AI controversies around artificial artificial intelligence . The most recent AI experiment was the creation of the OpenAI AI project . The AI project was created by OpenAI in 2009 and is now being developed by MIT MIT and MIT .
 Artificial intelligence is a field of research in computer science that studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals . It is the capability of a computer system that can perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as problem-solving, problem solving, and decision-making .
 The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, reasoning and planning . AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques to reach these goals . Some companies, such as Google DeepMind, aim to create artificial general intelligence that can complete virtually any cognitive task .
 Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms . Concerns have been raised about the long-term effects of generative AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety of the technology .
 Researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . Many algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they become exponentially slower as the problems grow . The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research .
 An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and relationships between those concepts . Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, but are also used in other areas such as clinical decision support and discovery .
 The most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonplace knowledge, the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge . An agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world . The difficulty of acquiring knowledge for AI applications is also the problem of obtaining knowledge for such applications .
 Decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation that measures how much the agent prefers it . For each possible action, the agent calculates the "expected utility" of all possible outcomes . It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility .
 An agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved . The space of possible future actions and situations is typically large, so agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be . A decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in particular way .
 Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically . It has been a part of AI from the beginning and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents . Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance .
 Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning . The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good" and shed for bad ones . Deep learning allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages .
 Deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding, transformers, deep learning architecture, and machine perception . In 2019, pre-trained language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the Bar exam and SAT tests .
 Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . The field includes speech recognition, image classification, object recognition, object tracking, androbotic perception. The field also includes the ability to analyze visual input.
 Artificial general intelligence can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions . AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above . There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search .
 "Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal . Adversarial search is used for chess or Go . Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by adjusting them to minimize a certain function .
 Swarm algorithms can coordinate via algorithms like Swarm intelligence or Swarm Swarm Swarm . Evolutionary computation aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" Swarm algorithms are inspired by bird-flocking and colony colony optimization .
 Problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is difficult to solve with backward reasoning with Horn .
 Logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1 . It can handle propositions that are vague and partially true . AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from math and economics . Prolog is competitive with computation in other types of programming languages .
 Tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan . These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, decision networks, Bayesian inference algorithms, and Bayesian networks . Algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data .
 The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., "if shiny then diamond then diamond"), and controllers . The most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm is the K-nearest neighbor algorithm . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience .
 An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons . Each node applies a function and once the data is transmitted to the next layer . It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data .
 In theory, a neural network can learn any function. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm . Deep learning uses many layers. The term 'perceptron' typically refers to a single-layer neural network. In contrast, deep learning uses a deep learning algorithm .
 CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects . Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing .
 The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) Deep learning is not known as of 2021 .
 Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "Hallucinations" These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems . Current models and services include ChatGPT,Claude,Gemini, and Meta AI .
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including search engines and search engines . The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as "Moore's law"
 Artificial intelligence can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research . The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer . AI-guided drug discovery helped find a new drug in 2023, it was reported that AI guided drug discovery .
 Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997 . IBM Watson defeated the two greatest Jeopardy!! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin .
 DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map . In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously play .
 These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers . They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised-supervised-tuning or human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems .
 Alibaba Group's Qwen2-Math model achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems . Microsoft proposed the techniquerStar-Math that leverages the technique leverages a Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model to solve 53% of the problems .
 Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics . Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed . Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum, argues that deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things .
 Various countries are deploying AI military applications . The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability . AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine . It is used for intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles .
 Genative artificial intelligence or Genative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses models to produce text, images, and other forms of data . Generative AI tools have become more common since the 2020s . Major tools include chatbots, chatbots and text-to-image models .
 Generative AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hard-working resources . Technology companies developing generative AI include companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Yandex .
 In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution . Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training . Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers .
 Uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content . It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result . Applications include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions .
 AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media . In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments .
 Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights" It is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy .
 Artificial intelligence has potential benefits and potential risks . AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems . As the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified . Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data .
 The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data . AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy . Some see AI as a necessary evil but others see it as unethical and a violation of the right to privacy .
 Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code . The output is then used under the rationale of "fair use" in courts . Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law .
 In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI . Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors . The commercial AI scene is dominated by tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Amazon and Microsoft .
 The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation . A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search .
 AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, according to technology firms . The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now .
 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million in March 2024 . Microsoft signed an agreement with Constellation Energy to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years . Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require strict regulatory processes .
 The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan . The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon . Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025 .
 Cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI . Nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI, CEO Wesley Kuo said .
 The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but this is below 1.5% of energy sector carbon emissions . The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and more content was recommended to keep people watching .
 The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society . After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem . It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda .
 The field of algorithmic bias studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases . Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black . The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people .
 Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon . COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants . The error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, but errors for each race were different .
 A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature . The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name) and the program will make the same decisions based on these features . Moritz Hardt said "fairness through blindness doesn't work"
 Machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past . It is descriptive rather than prescriptive. f these "recommendations" will likely be racist. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society .
 The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them . Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases . The use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed data should be curtailed .
 It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how it works . There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended . For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous .
 People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation . Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation included an explicit statement that this right exists . Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used .
 m. m. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output . LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model . The other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned .
 A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages and engages human targets without human supervision . 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' 'Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons'
 Machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours . Advanced AI can make authoritarian.centralized decision-making. more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as.markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare.
 In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI . A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment .
 Many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence . 70% of jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by AI in April 2023 . Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions such as healthcare and clergy .
 It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it . This could spell the end of the human race . Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them . It does not require human-like "sentience" to be an existential risk .
 The essential parts of civilization are not physical, argues Yuval Noah Harari . Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk . He argues that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anyt .
 The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI . Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly "good at persuasion" and getting better all the time .
 In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war" establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI .
 In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine . After 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research . Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority .
 The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, and was founded at an.AAAIsymposium in 2005 . Various AI models have been made open-weight, meaning their architecture and trained parameters (the "weights") are publicly available .
 Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed . They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses . An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework outlines four main ethical dimensions .
 The UK AI Safety Institute has released a toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence . The toolset is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages . It can be used to evaluate AI models .
 The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI . It is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms . The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation .
 The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values . Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher called for a government commission to regulate AI . OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence in 2023 .
 In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law" It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and other signatories . In a 2023/2023 survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks"
 The first global AI Safety Summit was held in 2023 to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks . 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI in May 2024 . AI patents in China and US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide .
 The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956 . Theory of computation led to Alan Turing's 'Turing test' which showed that machine intelligence was plausible . Researchers developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, such as the design for artificial neurons in 1943 and the creation of artificial neurons .
 Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s . They produced programs that the press described as "astonishing" Computers were learning to solve word problems, solving word problems in algebra, proving theorems and speaking English .
 The market for AI research was revived in the early 1980s by the commercial success of AI systems that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts . The "AI winter," a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed by the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987 .
 AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive . In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics and pattern recognition .
 AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems . Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field . Several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines .
 Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI . The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019 . The number of Google searches for the term "AI" accelerated in 2022 .
 In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player by itself . ChatGPT-3 became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months . About US$50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U.S. alone .
 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies . Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such asepistemology and free will . Alan Turing advised changing the question from "can machines think" to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour"
 The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior . It does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind" Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks"
 The leading AI textbook defines intelligence as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals . Another definition has been adopted by Google, which stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence .
 Some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely . This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms . No established unifying theory or dogma has guided AI research for most of its history .
 Some sources use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks" This approach is mostly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests . Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers .
 Sub-symbolic AI is a move away from "explainable" AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision . Critics such as Noam Chomsky say continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary for general intelligence .
 "Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles . "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems . Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in   were developed in  the 1980s .Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks .
 Artificial general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure . Modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions . The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively . There is no settled consensus on whether a machine can have a . machine's consciousness, sentience, and mind .
 Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence . David Chalmers named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness . The hard problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior .
 Computationalism argues that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing . The relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI r .
 It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient, and if so, to what degree . If there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals .
 European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems . Critics argue that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights . They also noted that robots lacked autonomy to take part in society on their own .
 A hypothetical agent would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind . Technology cannot improve exponentially indefinitely . Technology typically slows when it reaches the physical limits of what technology can do . Humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powe .
 Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity . Transhumanism has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and George Dyson . The word "robot" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play "R.U.R.R.," the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots"
 Isaac Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics . Popular culture includes films like The Terminator, The Matrix and The Day the Earth Stood Still . Some AI researchers consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is ambiguity .
 Philip K. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence . Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by the author, is based on the idea of artificial consciousness in cognitive science .
 Digital immortality – Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form – and the concept of digital immortality – is a hypothetical concept . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is coordinating a European initiative to generate and utilize real-world evidence to support the evaluation and supervision of medicines across the EU .
 This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004) and Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) It is among the reasons that experts are inefficient for capturing knowledge .
 Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine" AdSenseuses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve .
 Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Warren S. McCulloch, Walter Pitts, Walter Pitts and Arthur E. Bryson . Backpropagation was independently developed by Seppo Linnainmaa and Paul Werbos . In the 1990s, "our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small"
 A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may be viewed as biased in the ethical sense . Moritz Hardt argues machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains" when you're trying to design interventions that change the world"
 "Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time . The conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science . 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average of AI .
 The number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015 . There is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about, says Nils Nilsson in 1983 .
 The definition of "Strong AI" was presented by Richard Searle in 1999 . Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states" Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell & Norvig .
 Researchers: "Tech companies want to build artificial general intelligence. But who decides when AGI is attained?" The question of the source is a pastiche of: "Snow White" The proposal:McCarthy et al. (1955)
 Researchers have defined the criteria for cognitive reasoning and problem-solving . The criteria is: cognitive reasoning, problem solving, game playing, deduction, and deduction . This criteria is used in the study of cognitive theory . The definition of cognitive reasoning has been defined as "problems solving" and "problem solving"
 Psychological evidence of the prevalence of sub-symbolic reasoning and knowledge is psychological evidence . Researchers have used this type of evidence to suggest sub-sophisticated reasoning . The type of knowledge and knowledge can be expanded to the level of knowledge engineering and knowledge representation .
 Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998: "Poole," p. p. mockworth and p.m.5), p.248–256, 323–335, 323-335, and p.335-363: p.4.3.2.4 .

 The definition of "uncertain reasoning" is defined as "preparationist" and "conformant" planning, contingent planning, replanning (a.k.a. k. ng). Luger & Guha: "Uncertain preferences" (Luger & Norvig: "Lurger. et al. ng". Luger: "Where uncertain reasoning occurs?" is defined by uncertainty . The definition is "precisionist"
 The Economist (2016) published: "Artificial Intelligence (AI): What Is AI and How Does It Work? | Built In" The Economist.com.com Retrieved 30 October 2023: "What Is AI?" The Economist." The Economist . The Economist published a report on artificial intelligence in 2016: "The Economist"
 Human language processing and artificial general intelligence have been described as 'problems of cognitive computing' (NLP) Researchers have used language processing, computer vision, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence to solve problems of NLP problems . NLP is a form of formative language processing that can be used in artificial intelligence .

 Researchers: "Optimization Algorithms in Neural Networks" and "optimization" search: "Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and "Merkle & Middendorf (2013)" "KDnuggets" is the name of a network algorithm that optimizes networks' algorithms .
 Prolog-the language and its implementation compared with Lisp was compared to Lisp in 1977 . Prolog is the language of a modern programming language . It is now the language language of programming languages such as Prolog and Lisp . The language has been used in many scientific journals, such as Lisp .
 The Bayesian Bayesian networks are defined by Bayesian decision theory and the expectation–maximization algorithm . Markov model and Bayesian inference algorithms are defined as the result of Bayesian decisions and the expectations of a Bayesian network . Bayesian Decision Theory, Bayesian Decisions, Bayes Decision Theory and Bayes-Decision Networks have been defined by the Bayes' decision theory .
